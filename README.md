## Introduction

This repository is a collection of coding problems and solutions focused on the design and development of efficient, maintainable, and scalable software systems. The solutions aim to apply the principles of Low-Level Design to ensure code clarity, modularity, and extensibility.

## Design Patterns

This section contains examples of various design patterns implemented to solve specific problems. Some of the design patterns that you may find in this repository include:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Observer
- Strategy
- Adapter

## Code Examples

Each folder or file in this repository corresponds to a specific LLD problem. The files include both the problem description and the implemented solution with appropriate comments explaining the design decisions.

## Technologies Used

- Java / C++ / Python (or whichever language you are using for your practice)
- Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
- UML Diagrams (if applicable)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLD-Code-Practice.git
